de Bruijn CompAction in Low Memory

Possible use :

    ./bcalm input
compact input with l=8 in compacted.dot

    ./bcalm input output.dot
compact input with l=8 in output.dot

    ./bcalm input output.dot 10
compact input with l=10 in output.dot



Nota Bene :   
Higher l mean lower memory but the algorithm will NOT work with l>10.   
Also note that to use l>=8 you have to allow 260 open files (type `ulimit -n 260` in a terminal)
and 1100 for l=10 (`ulimit -n 1100`).

Input
=====

Each line in the input file is a distinct k-mer in upper-case, ending with his counting (not required). Here is a sample input:

AATCGATCG 3
ATCGATCGT 33
TCGATCGTA 645

It is the typical ouput of DSK with the dsk2ascii script (see http://minia.genouest.org/dsk/)

Output
=====

Each line is a simple path of the de Bruijn graph, in lowercase. Here is a sample output:

aatcgatcgta;
